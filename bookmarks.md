## @cremieuxrecueil - Agent Orange Exposure in Seveso
> The most extreme Agent Orange exposure incident wasn't from a war-torn jungle, it happened in Seveso, Italy when a chemical factory exploded in 1976.
>
> This is terrible, but also lucky, because unlike with Vietnam, we can trust Italian data. https://t.co/U8t2ByB4xA
>
> *Quoting @cremieuxrecueil:* The contaminant in Agent Orange that allegedly rendered it toxic is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD. As shown above, it is not elevated in Vietnam veterans compared to non-veterans and levels are not related to Agent Orange exposure.
>
> It is not consistently related to cancers, mortality, or anything else: https://t.co/VSbjrZdJMK
>
> TCDD is probably not carcinogenic in humans at all, and especially not at the doses people were or are likely to be exposed to: https://t.co/IBGYDBXGvQ
>
> TCDD might even be related to lower risk of cancer! (https://t.co/vmVW6vnUs7) But realistically, it's not: what we're seeing is the same thing we see when it's related to higher cancer risk in one-off studies. That is, statistical chance.
>
> Even with very large samples, the evidence for associations with cancers is virtually nonexistent. For example, in this case (https://t.co/LHkBjqog0h), they looked at bladder cancer, clearly did a huge number of tests, and after all was said and done, they managed to only get a hazard ratio of 1.04 (1.02-1.06), and they proceeded to prove they were looking for something be looking at, e.g., a bunch of p = 0.04 interactions. Not impressive.
>
> The risk from Agent Orange has been overstated by activists and advocates.
